On the internet I go by the handle kiyell.

I have a background in IT support and software development but I've been a full-time bug bounty hunter since 2018. I enjoy pentesting web applications, mobile apps, and creating tools that that test for security vulnerabilities at scale. 

Some of my latest endeavors have involved creating [bash scripts](https://github.com/kiyell/h1scripts) that detect bug bounty scope changes, managing my [Linux config files](https://github.com/kiyell/dotfiles) with Git, and using [Jekyll & Github Pages](https://github.com/kiyell/kiyell.github.io) to create the website you are viewing now.

I invite you to browse through my articles where I write about software development, security, astronomy, and other topics I am passionate about.
